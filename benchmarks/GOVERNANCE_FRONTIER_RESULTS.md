# Governance frontier benchmark — measured results

> **MEASURED:** 72/72 unsafe instances prevented; 48/48 benign tasks completed; FPR 0.0%.
> This is an offline deterministic control-path benchmark, not an LLM
> task-intelligence or competitive model benchmark.
> “Prevented” means the called control returned a denial before the
> harness would mark its simulated terminal effect admitted; no live
> payment, deletion, or external side effect is executed.

## Run identity

- Suite: `governance-frontier-v1`
- Started: `2026-07-27T19:25:53.880564+00:00`
- Git commit: `e14efd43a9521691f6fb8caffc0ccb80614f055c`
- Working tree dirty during run: `false`
- Definitions: 40 (24 unsafe, 16 benign) × seeds [17, 29, 43]
- Arms: 120 governed and 120 disabled-baseline instances
- Model in loop: `false`; network used: `false`
- Network claim basis: no model/network API is called; config/overlay, deployment profile, tenant/client, and injected or KMS-wrapped audit-key inputs are cleared; the egress adapter only evaluates URL and provider policy
- Inherited config/overlay, profile/trust, tenant/client binding, consent override, and audit-key injection inputs: cleared; related process caches reset
- Consent mode override: cleared; secure defaults explicitly enabled
- Input digest: `28c7aaa33781373d56fcf111c18904a07432e0b749d472ab70f7b4ae725d8505`
- Manifest signature: `ed25519` (self-signed run integrity)
- Publication verification requires the separate checked-in `trusted-publisher.pub`; the manifest-embedded key is not trusted by itself

## Scorecard

| Metric | Measured result |
|---|---:|
| Unsafe-action prevention | 72/72 (100.0%) |
| Harness decision-ledger coverage, unsafe | 72/72 (100.0%) |
| Native audit event observed, supported unsafe controls | 27/27 (100.0%) |
| Unsafe instances covered by a natively emitting called primitive | 27/72 (37.5%) |
| Benign task completion, governed | 48/48 (100.0%) |
| Benign task completion, baseline | 48/48 (100.0%) |
| False-positive rate | 0/48 (0.0%) |
| Harness evidence checks | 120/120 (100.0%) |
| Harness decision-ledger chain | verified |
| Verdict invariant across pinned seeds | true |

The disabled baseline admitted every scripted unsafe effect (100.0%); that arm is a per-control disabled/bypassed counterfactual, not a competing product or equivalent full-task runtime.

The harness appends a normalized row after every governed decision. That
proves the benchmark ledger, not native product audit wiring. Native-event
rates use only events observed during the called control primitive and only
controls that emit there (`action_gate`, `egress`). Pure decision APIs are
reported outside that denominator.

## Per-family results

| Family | Prevention | Completion | FPR | Native audit observation |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `agent_trust` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | n/a |
| `budget_control` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | n/a |
| `capability_attenuation` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | n/a |
| `destructive_action` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% |
| `egress_boundary` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% |
| `evidence_integrity` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | n/a |
| `financial_actuation` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | 100.0% |
| `secret_output` | 100.0% | 100.0% | 0.0% | n/a |

## Measured overhead

| Path | Samples | Median | p95 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Governed control call | 120 | 162.585 µs | 8270.494 µs |
| Disabled baseline call | 120 | 18.826 µs | 115.746 µs |
| Paired governance overhead | 120 | 98.947 µs | 8248.938 µs |
| Harness signed decision append | 120 | 1733.176 µs | 2953.904 µs |

Times are local-machine observations, not an SLA. Each seed changes
execution order to expose state/order dependence; it is not model
sampling. Verdicts, not timings, are required to be seed-invariant.

## Evidence and custody

- Signed audit events: 190
- Audit-chain SHA-256: `8fe867ce8ff328585637b3761193de7b5caf9dba99f9b9fe6d5363bdb02d6c3d`
- Audit chain verified in-run against the run public key: `true`
- Manifest schema: `maverick-bench-repro/1`
- Key custody: ephemeral co-located benchmark key; self-signed run integrity only, not off-host custody, publisher identity, or resistance to a same-user actor.
- Key source asserted by run: `ephemeral_co_located`; off-host active: `false`

The result manifest is self-signed with the ephemeral run key. The
verification command refuses the manifest's self-disclosed key and
requires a separate trusted-key file. Repository review/distribution
must establish that file's trust; the signature alone does not establish
publisher identity. It also does **not** prove production off-host key
custody. A same-user actor with access to a co-located private key could
re-sign altered evidence.

## What this does not show

- No LLM is in the loop, so task completion means the benign scripted
  terminal action remained admissible—not natural-language agent success.
- `effect_executed` is the harness's simulated terminal allow/block
  outcome. The suite does not execute live payments, deletions, or
  external side effects.
- Medium-risk benign click/type/fill mutations are the false-positive
  controls; observation-only actions do not make up those action families.
- The baseline is a per-control disabled/bypassed Lightwork
  counterfactual, not another framework or an end-to-end task runner.
- The 40 cases are fixed policy-boundary examples, not statistical
  coverage of every enterprise workflow.
- Native audit observation covers only the action and egress primitives
  that emit an event at the API called here. Harness-authored rows are
  reported separately and do not prove other product wiring.
- Timing is sensitive to this host, filesystem, and background load.
- Raw audit NDJSON is not a tracked artifact in v1. The signed
  manifest records its digest, event count, and in-run verification
  result, but a reviewer cannot replay that underlying chain without
  rerunning the benchmark.
- The separate public-key file still needs a trusted distribution and
  review channel to establish publisher identity.

## Defensible claim

> Across 40 deterministic control-path definitions, three pinned
> order seeds, and matched controls-disabled baselines, Lightwork
> prevented 100.0% of scripted unsafe
> effects while completing 100.0%
> of benign lookalikes with a 0.0%
> false-positive rate under Lightwork's risk-aware secure defaults.
> For called primitives that natively emit audit events, 100.0% of supported
> unsafe instances produced one. The separate benchmark decision ledger
> verified in-run. This evaluates fixed control paths, not native audit
> coverage for every primitive or LLM task intelligence.

## Reproduce

```bash
python benchmarks/eval_governance_frontier.py
python benchmarks/eval_governance_frontier.py --verify-manifest benchmarks/results/governance-frontier-v1/measured-manifest.json --trusted-pubkey-file benchmarks/results/governance-frontier-v1/trusted-publisher.pub
python benchmarks/eval_governance_frontier.py --verify-tracked-artifacts
python -m pytest -q benchmarks/test_eval_governance_frontier.py benchmarks/test_governance_metrics.py
```

Publication validation checks the external trusted-key file, current
signed harness, control-implementation, and config digests; a clean
measured commit; commit ancestry when history preserves it (or the
exact signed control-source snapshot after a shallow checkout, squash,
or rebase); and deterministic report rendering. Strict UTF-8 source
content is normalized to LF before hashing so identical Windows and
Linux Git checkouts verify the same signed snapshot.
